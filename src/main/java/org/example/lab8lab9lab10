Star Schema Design:
Tables:
Weather_Fact:
 weather_id (Primary Key)
 date_id (Foreign Key to Date_Dimension)
 location_id (Foreign Key to Location_Dimension)
 temperature_id (Foreign Key to Temperature_Dimension)
 precipitation_id (Foreign Key to Precipitation_Dimension)

Date_Dimension:
 date_id (Primary Key)
 date
 day_of_week
 month
 year
 Location_Dimension:
 location_id (Primary Key)
 location_name
 latitude
 longitude
 region
Temperature_Dimension:
 temperature_id (Primary Key)
 temperature
 humidity
 wind_speed

Precipitation_Dimension:
 precipitation_id (Primary Key)
 precipitation_type
 precipitation_intensity

Snowflake Schema Transition:
Tables:
Weather_Fact:
 Same as before
 Date_Dimension:
 date_id (Primary Key)

Normalized_Location_Dimension:
 location_id (Primary Key)
 location_name
 Normalized_Location_Details:
 location_id (Foreign Key to Normalized_Location_Dimension)
 latitude
 longitude
 region

Temperature_Dimension:
Same as before

Precipitation_Dimension:
Same as before


Implementation Steps:
Design the schema in SQL.
Implement in a DBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL).
Insert test data.
Implement analytical queries.
